# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Udacity Data Analyst - Project I
## summary
- In this project, I will explore data related to bike sharing systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York, and Washington. using Python.
- I will write code to import data and answer interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics.
- I will also write a script that takes raw inputs to create an interactive experience in the device to present these stats. 
## What Software Do I Need to complete this project?
To complete this project, I will order the following software:
1. Python 3, NumPy, and pandas using Anaconda
2. A text editor, like Visual Studio Code or Sublime or Atom.
3. A terminal application, like Git.
## The Datasets:
1. Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the
data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
2. The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year
## Statistics Computed:
1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time):
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day
2. Popular stations and trip:
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
3. Trip duration:
- total travel time
- average travel time
4. User info:
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
## Points for Input collection:
1. The City input: Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
2. Month input (If they chose month): Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
3. Day input (If they chose day): Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?
4. Ask The user to display raw data samples of 5 rows.
5. After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.
